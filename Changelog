	* Added more documentation.

2009-07-19	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* Enums.cs: corrected hash names.
	* GpgmeMemoryData.cs: give the user the possibility to allocate memory
	  by himself.
	* GpgmeStreamData.cs: Added a new property to retrieve the origin 
	  stream instance.
	* Corrected typo; ExpireDate -> ExpirationDate.
	* Added more documentation.


2009-07-18	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* GpgmeData.cs: corrected constructor access modifier.
	* Added more documentation.

2009-07-14	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* Added more documentation.

2009-07-13	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* Signature.cs: added missing Next reference.
	* Samples: added new enumeration to show signature verification.
	* Added more documentation.

2009-07-10	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* Corrected Copyright in AUTHORS file.
	* Added more documentation.

2009-07-09	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* Added more documentation (monodoc).
	* Added an easy Makefile.

2009-07-08	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* Removed superfluous Exception classes.
	* Changed some GpgmeExceptions to more appropriate existing Exceptions.
	* GenkeyResult.cs: fixed a stack overflow.
	* Added docs.

2009-07-07	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* Added more samples.
	* Rename of some methods.

2009-06-29	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* PgpKey.cs: Corrected Sign(..), RevokeSignature(..) and 
	  DeleteSignature(..). You need to specify ONE uid and one or more
	  signature numbers. 
	* Added Samples directory.

2009-06-24	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* GpgmeCbsData.cs: Corrected double free() of cbsPtr.
	  Added thread safety for ReleaseCB(..)
	* All files: start to separate P/Invoke declarations (public -> 
	  internal). Make "internal" functions invisible to the user.

2009-06-22	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* First steps to fix 64bit problems (P/Invoke).
	* First steps to fix stacktrace with gpgme_data_new_from_cbs(..).
	  On Linux/Unix platforms _release_cb(..) is called AFTER the 
	  deconstructor ~GpgmeCbsData() has freed the user supplied cbs
	  structure with its callback functions. This will be a problem on
	  Windows platforms as well as soon as the number of parallel threads
	  and CPUs raises.
	* Added global/local locking for some functions that call 
	  Marshal.FreeCoTaskMem(..).


2009-06-15	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* Added _gpgme_signature_windows.cs to allow GPG signature verify on 
	  Windows platforms (See BUGS for more information).

2009-06-09	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* GpgmeCbsData.cs: 
	  GpgmeStreamData.cs:
	  GpgmeFileData: Corrected CanRead, CanWrite, CanSeek and CanRelease.
	* Tested encryption of memory based input buffer to file/stream based 
	  output buffer.
	* Tested signature of file/stream based input buffer to file/stream
	  based output buffer.
	* GpgmeMemoryData.cs: Rename of Dispose(bool) to ReleaseMemoryData().

2009-06-05	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* GgpmeData.cs: now inherited from Stream.
	  Implemented Read(..), Write(..), Seek(..), SetLength(..), etc. where
	  possible.

2009-06-04	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* Global: renamed method names (*PGP* -> Pgp)
	* corrected AddSubkey for PGP keys
	* corrected key algorithm types and capability
	* corrected DelSignature for PGP keys

2009-05-19	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* AlgorithmCapability.cs: Added GetKeyUsageText(..)
	* GnupgKeyParms.cs: Corrected PGP key creation. It is now possible to
	  create RSA (Sign/Encrypt/Auth) key pairs.
	* Global: changed PubKey* to Pubkey*, SubKey* to Subkey*
