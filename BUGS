* CRITICAL: Linux x86 (32bit)
  File: GpgmeMemoryData.cs

  On 32bit Linux the Gpgme memory based data buffer does not work. Still
  investigating the issue. 
  Example: Examples/DataBufferSamples/DataBufferTest/Program.cs

  Thanks to Juan Castro for reporting!

* MAJOR: Windows - Key signatures
  File: Lib/_gpgme_signature.cs
  Line 71

  GPG4WIN seems to have a different _gpgme_signature struct layout in memory.
  Between 'int _unused : 28;' and 'gpgme_validity validity;' are 4 x 4 bytes
  missing. The area is filled up with null (\0). This results in memory access
  violations, because 'pka_address' is pointer (const char*) and we are trying
  to read from this position. If we do not respect the different memory layout
  pka_address contains garbage.
  WORKAROUND: created two versions of _gpgme_signature -> one for Windows and
  one for Linux.
  TODO: ask the guys at the GnuPG mailing list for help..
